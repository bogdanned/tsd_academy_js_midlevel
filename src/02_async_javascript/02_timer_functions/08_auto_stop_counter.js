/*
Implement an Auto-Stopping Counter
Objective:
Create a function called autoStoppingCounter that takes an integer n 
and a delay in milliseconds. The function should print integers 
starting from 1 up to n at each delay interval and then stop.

The function should use setInterval to print integers.
When the counter reaches n, it should use clearInterval to stop the counter.
If n is less than 1, the function should immediately print "Invalid input".
*/
function autoStoppingCounter(n, delay) {
    // Implement this function
}

module.exports = autoStoppingCounter;
